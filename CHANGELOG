2011-01-20 v1.1.1
-----------------

* Change sorting of job list to use 'start after' date

2010-12-29 v1.1.0
-----------------

* Use php's serialise instead of JSON serialisation (what was I thinking!).
  We're not going to be doing JS distribution just yet...
* Version bump as the serialisation change may have some weird effects
  on existing scheduled jobs that have complex data serialised

2010-12-24 v1.0.6
-----------------
* Fix bug where admins couldn't execute other users' jobs via the UI

2010-12-12 v1.0.5
-----------------
* Fixed E_DEPRECATED notices in PHP 5.3 causing an exception during job processing.

2010-11-30 v1.0.4
-----------------

* Allow jobs to be deleted when they're paused

2010-11-29 v1.0.3
-----------------

* FEATURE: Added abiltity to directly execute a job from the queue without needing the background process running. Job executes immediately in browser as the user running the job

2010-11-11 v1.0.2
-----------------

* Added ability to specify a RunAs user when creating the job

2010-11-06 v1.0.1
-----------------

* Update to fix a javascript problem referencing the wrong url

2010-11-01 v1.0.0
-----------------

* Helper to double check the status of any 'running' job that may have stalled.
* Added example job that generates a google sitemap in the background
  (instead of each request). Handy for large sites.

v0.1.2
-------------

* Added additional method prepareForRestart that is called on QueuedJobs
  whenever a job is restarted

v0.1.1
-------------

* Changed admin URL param (seriously, why on earth did I put _queued-jobs?)
* Added more memory information

2010-06-20 v0.1.0
-------------

* Added better support for jobs that should be executed after a particular
  time delay. 

2010-05-15 v0.1.0 RC1
-----------------


* Initital release
* Cron based initiation of a single task that manages the processing of jobs
  that take more processing than what is feasible to achieve in a single
  HTTP request. Manages the queueing, state and continuation of jobs over
  time to ensure load doesn't become too high on the server.
