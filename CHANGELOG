  whenever a job is restarted

  time delay. 

2010-05-15 v0.1.0 RC1
-----------------


* Initital release
* Cron based initiation of a single task that manages the processing of jobs
  that take more processing than what is feasible to achieve in a single
  HTTP request. Manages the queueing, state and continuation of jobs over
  time to ensure load doesn't become too high on the server.
