-----------------
2010-05-15

* Initital release
* Cron based initiation of a single task that manages the processing of jobs
  that take more processing than what is feasible to achieve in a single
  HTTP request. Manages the queueing, state and continuation of jobs over
  time to ensure load doesn't become too high on the server.
